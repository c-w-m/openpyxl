    "# [Development](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/development.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find the openpyxl project intriguing and want to contribute a new awesome\n",
    "feature, fix a nasty bug or improve the documentation this section will guide you\n",
    "in setting up your development environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look into the coding standards and version control system workflows used,\n",
    "as well as cloning the openpyxl code to your local machine, setting up a virtual\n",
    "Python environment, running tests and building the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting the source\n",
    "\n",
    "The source code of openpyxl is hosted on `Heptapod <https://foss.heptapod.net/openpyxl/openpyxl>`_\n",
    "as a Mercurial project which you can download using e.g. the GUI client\n",
    "`SourceTree <http://www.sourcetreeapp.com>`_ by Atlassian. If you prefer working\n",
    "with the command line you can use the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "    $ hg clone \\https://foss.heptapod.net/openpyxl/openpyxl\n",
    "    $ hg up |version|\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that the default branch should never be used for development\n",
    "work. For bug fixes and minor patches you should base your work on the branch\n",
    "of the current release, e.g |version|. New features should generally be based\n",
    "on the development branch of the **next** minor version. If in doubt get in\n",
    "touch with the openpyxl development team.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worthwhile to add an upstream remote reference to the\n",
    "original repository to update your fork with the latest changes, by adding\n",
    "to the `./hg/hgrc` file the following::\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "    [paths]\n",
    "    default = ...\n",
    "    openpyxl-master = https://foss.heptapod.net/openpyxl/openpyxl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then grab any new changes using::\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "    $ hg pull openpyxl-master\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After that you should create a virtual environment using `virtualenv`\n",
    "and install the project requirements and the project itself::\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "    $ cd openpyxl\n",
    "    $ virtualenv openpyxl-env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Activate the environment using::\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "    $ source bin/activate  # or ./openpyxl-env/Scripts/activate on Windows\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the dev and prod dependencies and the package itself using::\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "    (openpyxl-env) $ pip install -U -r requirements.txt\n",
    "    (openpyxl-env) $ pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that contributions to the project without tests will **not** be accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `pytest` as the test runner with `pytest-cov` for coverage information and\n",
    "`pytest-flakes` for static code analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run all the tests you need to either execute::\n",
    "\n",
    "    (openpxyl-env) $ pytest -xrf openpyxl  # the flags will stop testing at the first error\n",
    "\n",
    "Or use `tox` to run the tests on different Python versions and\n",
    "configurations::\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "    $ tox openpyxl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coverage\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is 100 % coverage for unit tests - data types and utility functions.\n",
    "Coverage information can be obtained using::\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "    py.test --cov openpyxl\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Organisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Tests should be preferably at package / module level e.g `openpyxl/cell`. This\n",
    "makes testing and getting statistics for code under development easier::\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "    py.test --cov openpyxl/cell openpyxl/cell\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking XML\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `openpyxl.tests.helper.compare_xml` function to compare\n",
    "generated and expected fragments of XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Schema validation\n",
    "\n",
    "When working on code to generate XML it is possible to validate that the\n",
    "generated XML conforms to the published specification. Note, this won't\n",
    "necessarily guarantee that everything is fine but is preferable to reverse\n",
    "engineering!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Microsoft Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with the SDK, Microsoft also has a [\"Productivity Tool\"](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30425) for working with Office OpenXML.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to quickly inspect or compare whole Excel files.\n",
    "Unfortunately, validation errors contain many false positives. The tool also\n",
    "contain links to the specification and implementers' notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## File Support and Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary aim of openpyxl is to support reading and writing Microsoft Excel\n",
    "2010 files. These are zipped OOXML files that are specified by [ECMA 376](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm) and [ISO 29500](http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Where possible we try to support files generated by other libraries or\n",
    "programs, but can't guarantee it, because often these do not strictly adhere\n",
    "to the above format.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Support of Python Versions\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3.6 and upwards are supported\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coding style\n",
    "\n",
    "We orient ourselves at PEP-8 for the coding style, except when implementing\n",
    "attributes for roundtripping. Despite that you are encouraged to use Python\n",
    "data conventions (boolean, None, etc.). Note exceptions from this convestion\n",
    "in docstrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Contributing\n",
    "\n",
    "Contributions in the form of pull requests are always welcome. Don't forget\n",
    "to add yourself to the list of authors!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Branch naming convention\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a \"major.minor.patch\" numbering system, ie. |release|. Development\n",
    "branches are named after \"major.minor\" releases. In general, API change will\n",
    "only happen major releases but there will be exceptions. Always communicate\n",
    "API changes to the mailing list before making them. If you are changing an\n",
    "API try and an implement a fallback (with deprecation warning) for the old\n",
    "behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"default branch\" is used for releases and always has changes from a\n",
    "development branch merged in. It should never be the target for a pull\n",
    "request.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pull Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "Pull requests should be submitted to the current, unreleased development\n",
    "branch. Eg. if the current release is |release|, pull requests should be made\n",
    "to the |version| branch. Exceptions are bug fixes to released versions which\n",
    "should be made to the relevant release branch and merged upstream into\n",
    "development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please use `tox` to test code for different submissions **before**\n",
    "making a pull request. This is especially important for picking up problems\n",
    "across Python versions.\n",
    "\n",
